# Langchain.rb a is library for building LLM-backed Ruby applications. It is an abstraction layer that sits on top of the emerging AI-related tools that makes it easy for developers to consume and string those services together.
#
# = Installation
# Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:
#
#     $ bundle add langchainrb
#
# If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:
#
#     $ gem install langchainrb
#
# Require the gem to start using it:
#
#     require "langchain"
#
# = Concepts
#
# == Processors
# Processors load and parse/process various data types such as CSVs, PDFs, Word documents, HTML pages, and others.
#
# == Chunkers
# Chunkers split data based on various available options such as delimeters, chunk sizes or custom-defined functions. Chunkers are used when data needs to be split up before being imported in vector databases.
#
# == Prompts
# Prompts are structured inputs to the LLMs. Prompts provide instructions, context and other user input that LLMs use to generate responses.
#
# == Large Language Models (LLMs)
# LLM is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabeled text using self-supervised learning or semi-supervised learning.
#
# == Vectorsearch Databases
# Vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. Each vector has a certain number of dimensions, which can range from tens to thousands, depending on the complexity and granularity of the data.
#
# == Embedding
# Word embedding or word vector is an approach with which we represent documents and words. It is defined as a numeric vector input that allows words with similar meanings to have the same representation. It can approximate meaning and represent a word in a lower dimensional space.
#
#
# = Logging
#
# LangChain.rb uses standard logging mechanisms and defaults to :debug level. Most messages are at info level, but we will add debug or warn statements as needed. To show all log messages:
#
# Langchain.logger.level = :info
module Langchain
  class << self
    # @return [ContextualLogger]
    attr_reader :logger

    # @param logger [Logger]
    # @return [ContextualLogger]
    def logger=(logger)
      @logger = ContextualLogger.new(logger)
    end

    # @return [Pathname]
    attr_reader :root
  end

  self.logger ||= ::Logger.new($stdout, level: :warn)

  @root = Pathname.new(__dir__)

  module Errors
    class BaseError < StandardError; end
  end
end
